# chinese-food-175-dataset
The dataset contains sample images of 175 types of dishes, with 100 to 300 images for each dish, primarily focusing on Chinese cuisine. The images are sourced from the internet and can be used for training machine learning image recognition models. The images have already been inspected and selected manually once, which means the samples are generally correct but may still contain some mistakes. You can download this dataset in 'Releases'.(Attention: Due to the huge size of the dataset, it is divided into 2 parts before uploading. You need to move all the files from these two parts to one folder named 'chinese-food-175'. After that, 'dataset_loading.py' can be used to load these files and create two variables named 'images' and 'labels', which contain the images and labels that are essential to training.)

Here are some samples.

All the images are collected from the intenet. If there are copyright issues involved, please contact and I will remove this dataset.
