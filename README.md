# chinese-food-175-dataset
The dataset contains sample images of 175 types of dishes, with 100 to 300 images for each dish, primarily focusing on Chinese cuisine. The images are sourced from the internet and can be used for training machine learning image recognition models. The images have already been inspected and selected manually once, which means the samples are generally correct but may still contain some mistakes. You can download this dataset in 'Releases'.

Here are some samples.
